# Changes to be made for v2:
## For Sure:
- Move RESET and POWER buttons closer to pcb edge
- Change batter connection to be vertical instead of right angle connector
- Move reset trace such that it is not about battery trace

## Potential:
- Switch to surface mount diodes?
- Add LEDs for backlight?
- Move thumb cluster keys to be at a lesser angle?
